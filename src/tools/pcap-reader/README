	pcap-reader:
	Parse a pcap file and communicate results to spind


==> Introduction

The program in this repository parses a PCAP file and communicates its findings
to spind through a socket.


==> Dependencies

 * libpcap


==> Compiling the program

Make sure you passed --enable-pcap-reader to the SPIN configure script. Once
you've done that, you can run make in this directory to build pcap-reader.

  $ cd spin/src/
  $ autoreconf --install
  $ ./configure --enable-pcap-reader
  $ make
  $ cd tools/pcap-reader/
  $ make


==> Usage

Parse file.pcap.

  $ sudo ./pcap-reader -r file.pcap

Listen on eth0.

  $ sudo ./pcap-reader -i eth0

Note: for now, it is necessary to run pcap-reader as root. This is because the
socket created by spind can only be written to by the root user.
